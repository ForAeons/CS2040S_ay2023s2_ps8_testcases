# Problem Set 8: Travelling Salesman Problem

This repository is solely meant for NUS students who are taking CS2040S. The purpose of this
repository is to provide a test file for students' implementation of TSPGraph.java.

1. Note that time complexity tests does not test for the correctness of the algorithm. It only tests for the time complexity of the algorithm.
2. Time complexity test for MST and TSP can run for a long time. It took 1 minute plus for each of them on my PC. You can comment out the time complexity test for 10000 input size if you want to run the test faster.

## Description

TSPGraphTester.java is a JUnit test file that contains multiple test cases to check the functionality and performance of the student's implementation of TSPGraph.java. The test cases cover various aspects, such as time complexity, validity of the tour, and tour distance calculation. In addition, there is an encouraging test case at the end, reminding students that they can overcome any challenges they face during the implementation process.
